# Molecular-representation-of-quantum-circuits

This repository demonstrates an algorithm that generates a molecular representation of quantum circuits, which can help with optimizing quantum ansatz for quantum machine learning.

This repository includes the codes used to generate the results presented in the manuscript "Molecular representations of quantum circuits for quantum machine learning". (E. Torabian, R. V. Krems, Molecular representations of quantum circuits for quantum machine learning, arXiv:, (2025), https://arxiv.org/abs/.)
